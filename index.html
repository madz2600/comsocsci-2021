        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we investigate how locals and tourists of the Danish city Copenhagen each perceive the city in both their visitation behaviour and how to rate it.
            To do this, we will use data from Google Maps reviews of ~70 points of interest (POI) varying in popularity. We measure popularity with the amount of reviews.
        </p>

        <h2>The data</h2>
        <p>
            Our data consists of exactly 73 POIs with a total of 60,282 reviews. With each review, we extracted the tokens from the text and used the library langdetect to categorize
            the nationality of the reviews. After this, we have 15 columns, with these important ones:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>caption: The text of the review.</li>
            <li>relative_date: Time since reading the review, as reviews do not have exact dates.</li>
            <li>rating: A 1-5 integer rating of the POI.</li>
            <li>username: The public identification of the user, which is not unique.</li>
            <li>n_review_user: Count of how many total reviews the user has.</li>
            <li>attraction: The name of the POI.</li>
            <li>english: English tokens from the caption, will be null if the caption is Danish and vice versa.</li>
            <li>danish: Danish variant of the column "english".</li>
            <li>nationality: Either "da", "en" or null, used to determine if review is from a local or a tourist.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pre-analysis</h2>
        <p>
            We start by taking a few looks at the general sense of our data. On <span class="ref" data-ref="reviews_distribution"></span> we can see the distribution of reviews per POI.

        </p>
        <div class="figure center-content" data-ref="reviews_distribution">
            <img width=500 src="./figures/reviews_distribution.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">The distribution of reviews. Note the clustering of ~1,000 reviews.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            As Google Maps has a limit to how many reviews can be seen on a page (about 1,000), we are severely limited on POIs with many thousands of reviews. This is taken into
            consideration in our project. To divide the POIs evenly into groups based on popularity, we see there would be the last and second last bin, with the rest of the bins
            filling out the last group.
        </p>
        <div class="figure center-content" data-ref="distribution_nationalities">
            <img width=500 src="./figures/distribution_nationalities.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">The most frequent nationalities in our data.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            From here we can see that Danish reviews account for about 1/3 of reviews with text and the rest of the nationalities total about 2/3.
        </p>
        <div class="figure center-content" data-ref="ratings_da_en">
            <img width=500 src="./figures/ratings_da_en.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">Frequency of the initial ratings. A user can rate 1-5 on a POI.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Here we see the initial ratings of the written reviews, we see that Danish reviews are generally lower than English. We will compare this distribution with sentiment later in the text analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>Text Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            We start with looking at the tokens computed from the data preparation. These can be joined to a collected document for Danish and English respectively and computed in a wordcloud.
            These wordclouds can be seen on <span class="ref" data-ref="wordclouds"></span>
        </p>
        <div class="figure center-content" data-ref="wordclouds">
            <img width=400 src="./figures/wordcloud_en.png">
            <img width=400 src="./figures/wordcloud_da.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">Wordclouds of both Danish and English tokens.</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Network Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            How do locals and tourists connect different POIs?
        </p>

        <p>
            How do locals and tourists connect different POIs? <br>
            This look nice
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            What did we learn?
        </p>

        <h2>Further Research</h2>
        <p>
            We have an idea for how this project could evolve. For the tokens of the reviews, it could be possible to categorize the tokens in groups like fun, history, family etc.
            to analyse what kind of goal a group of people seek when visiting Copenhagen or another specific location.
