        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we investigate how locals and tourists of the Danish city Copenhagen each perceive the city in both their visitation behaviour and how to rate it.
            To do this, we will use data from Google Maps reviews of ~70 points of interest (POI) varying in popularity. We measure popularity with the amount of reviews.
            <br>
            <br>
            (Disclaimer: The terms tourists, internationals, foreigners etc will have same meaning and will be used
            interchangeable. The same goes for the terms locals, Danes, residents etc. All these have the same meaning and will
            be used interchangeable as well.)

        </p>

        <h2>The data</h2>
        <p>
            Our data consists of exactly 73 POIs with a total of 60,282 reviews. With each review, we extracted the tokens from the text and used the library langdetect to categorize
            the nationality of the reviews. After this, we have 15 columns, with these important ones:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>caption: The text of the review.</li>
            <li>relative_date: Time since reading the review, as reviews do not have exact dates.</li>
            <li>rating: A 1-5 integer rating of the POI.</li>
            <li>username: The public identification of the user, which is not unique.</li>
            <li>n_review_user: Count of how many total reviews the user has.</li>
            <li>attraction: The name of the POI.</li>
            <li>english: English tokens from the caption, will be null if the caption is Danish and vice versa.</li>
            <li>danish: Danish variant of the column "english".</li>
            <li>nationality: Either "da", "en" or null, used to determine if review is from a local or a tourist.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pre-analysis</h2>
        <p>
            We start by taking a few looks at the general sense of our data. On <span class="ref" data-ref="reviews_distribution"></span> we can see the distribution of reviews per POI.

        </p>
        <div class="figure center-content" data-ref="reviews_distribution">
            <img width=500 src="./figures/reviews_distribution.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">The distribution of reviews. Note the clustering of ~1,000 reviews.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            As Google Maps has a limit to how many reviews can be seen on a page (about 1,000), we are severely limited on POIs with many thousands of reviews. This is taken into
            consideration in our project. To divide the POIs evenly into groups based on popularity, we see there would be the last and second last bin, with the rest of the bins
            filling out the last group.
        </p>
        <div class="figure center-content" data-ref="distribution_nationalities">
            <img width=500 src="./figures/distribution_nationalities.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">The most frequent nationalities in our data.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            From here we can see that Danish reviews account for about 1/3 of reviews with text and the rest of the nationalities total about 2/3.
        </p>
        <div class="figure center-content" data-ref="ratings_da_en">
            <img width=500 src="./figures/ratings_da_en.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">Frequency of the initial ratings. A user can rate 1-5 on a POI.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Here we see the initial ratings of the written reviews, we see that Danish reviews are generally lower than English. We will compare this distribution with sentiment later in the text analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>Text Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            We start with looking at the tokens computed from the data preparation. These can be joined to a collected document for Danish and English respectively and computed in a wordcloud.
            These wordclouds can be seen on <span class="ref" data-ref="wordclouds"></span>.
        </p>
        <div class="figure center-content" data-ref="wordclouds">
            <img width=400 src="./figures/wordcloud_en.png">
            <img width=400 src="./figures/wordcloud_da.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">Wordclouds of both Danish and English tokens.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            We see some similarity between these two wordclouds, like "museum" and "exhibit". A few interesting notes are that words like words like museum and church appear more frequently
            in the English wordcloud than the Danish, while the word cozy is very frequent in the Danish. The English also has time as a frequent word. This could correspond with tourists having
            less time than locals, and would prioritise POIs worth the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We did a sentiment analysis on the captions of the reviews, to compare how they compare with the ratings. The distribution can be seen on <span class="ref" data-ref="sentiment_comparison"></span>.
        </p>
        <div class="figure center-content" data-ref="sentiment_comparison">
            <img width=500 src="./figures/sentiment_da_en.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">Comparing the sentiment scores (from -1 to 1) between Danish and English reviews. The scores are binned to fit with the 1-5 rating Google Maps has.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            We see somewhat the same distributions as <span class="ref" data-ref="ratings_da_en"></span> with a difference around the neutral score. A lot more reviews are considered neutral through
            sentiment analysis. Otherwise we see the same trend of the Danish reviews being generally lower. Overall, there is some correlation between high rating/score and low rating/score.
        </p>

        <h2>Network Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Turning our data into a network</h3>
        <p>
            In order to analyse the behavioral patterns of locals versus the tourists it makes sense
            to try and model our data as a network.
            We turn our data into a network with the following procedure. Each attraction is a node and two nodes are connected
            by an edge if the same person has reviewed in other words visited both attractions.
            Each edge further gets a weight which corresponds to how many people have visited both
            attractions the given edge is connecting.
            <br>
            <br>
            We will create 2 networks, one for locals and one for tourists. Only observations/reviews that have a caption
            can be categorised as either danish or foreign i.e. be used in the networks.
            In order to properly compare the two networks we were forced to scale the tourist network down to the same
            size as the locals network. After having done so we get these 2 networks:
        </p> 
        <div class="figure" data-ref="da_and_tour_plot">
            <img height=500 src="images/da_and_tour_plot.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">Local and tourist networks computed from reviews.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            We see that both the normalized tourist network and the danish network has all 73 nodes/attractions present.
            From the avg degree/ num. egdes we notice that the tourist network seems a bit more connected.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>A closer look at the comparison of the two networks.</h3>

        <p>
            We will start out by plotting the most and least connected nodes for both networks based on a
            combined degree-edge-weight metric. For a given node this will be equal to two times its
            degree plus the sum of the weights of all edges that connect to the node. The reason for this
            metric is to try and emphasis nodes that have a lot of connections (high degree) but also nodes
            which has strong connections (high edge weight) to other nodes.
            <br>
            For good measure we will include a random network where it makes sense to do so.
            The random network will be constructed in such a way, it has the same properties as the average of our two
            networks, in terms of degrees, nodes, weights etc.
        </p>
        <div class="figure" data-ref="lows_n_highs">
            <img height=450 src="images/lows_n_highs.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">Comparison of the attraction node "strength" for both locals and tourists.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            These results give some insigt to what the locals prefer versus the tourists. It is clear that they have
            very different preferences, and that the tourists
            prefer the famous, traditional and big attractions such as Christiansborg, The little Mermaid and the
            Round Tower, where as the danes prefer the more "local" and down to earth attractions such as Valby Park,
            Søndermarken and The Hermitage Hunting Lodge.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            To more directly look at the attractions with the biggest interest difference we plot the
            degree-edge-weight for each attraction for both the locals and tourists.
        </p>
        <div class="figure" data-ref="sorted_by_name">
            <img height=315 src="images/sorted_by_name.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">Combined comparison of attraction node "strength" for both locals and tourists.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            <br>
            <br>
            Some high interest points of locals which are of low interest for the tourists are: Bakken, Sophienholm,
            Freedom Museum etc.
            <br>
            Some high interest points of tourists which are of low interest for the locals are: Gefion Fountain,
            Kastellet, Det Kongelige Bibliotek etc.
            <br>
            Again its apperent that the danes prefer parks and more subtle attractions where as the tourists focus
            on the bigger traditionel attractions.
        </p>

        <h3>A look at their density distribution:</h3>

        <div class="figure" data-ref="dist">
            <img height=500 src="images/dist.png">
            <div class="caption">
                <span class="text">Comparing the two networks with a random network using a distribution of node "strength".</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            In this plot it does very much make sense to including the random network as it clearly shows that the
            random network is much more centered around some mean value and doesnt have nearly the same amount of
            extremes as in either the local or danes network. This demonstrates that the 2 networks are not infact
            just random.
            <br>
            <br>
            From this plot we expected that the locals would have had a greater amount of density in the low-mid
            end as this would show that they had visited a wider and more diverse amount of attracktions and not just
            the most popular onces. This does not seem to be the case, as the two distributions are very alike. Although,
            the opposite is true with respect to the tourists. As its clear from the density that the tourists have a
            greater amount of outliers in the high end, compared to the locals. This can be interpreted as the tourists
            having a few very central and popular attractions that they are likely to attend if they visit Denmark.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Other network properties:</h3>
        <p>
            Lastly we could take a look at some other network properties such as the average shortest path
            and the clustering coefficient:
            <br>
            <br>
            Average shortest path length in the Tourist network:   1.655
            <br>
            Average shortest path length in the Local network:     1.705
            <br>
            Average shortest path length in the Random network:    1.653
            <br>
            <br>
            The clustering coefficient of the Tourist network is: 0.486
            <br>
            The clustering coefficient of the Local network is:   0.474
            <br>
            The clustering coefficient of the Random network is:  0.353
            <br>
            <br>

            As expected the local and tourist network are more clustered than the random network indicating that they
            are infact not just random. We further see that the average shortest path for the tourist is less than
            for the locals, meaning that there is a greater diversity in what the tourist visit as the attractions
            are connected via shorter paths. We would have expected the opposite.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>One big short coming of the network analysis:</h3>
        <p>
            Because we are limited to 1000 reviews per attraction we are faced with some big shortcomings with
            respect to the network analyses. For instance the biggest attractions such as Tivoli Gardens with 50.000+
            reviews should definitely be a big interconnections in the network, but this is not the case in our networks
            since we only have the 1000 most recent reviews thus neglecting a lot of possible connections to or from Tivoli
            Gardens and therefore not properly representing Tivoli Gardens. Only having the most recent reviews will also
            favour the Tourists: A Tourist is likely to have visited a lot of attractions in a short span. Whereas some
            local might have visited overall more places, but have done so over a longer period of time. Therefore it is
            very likely that not all not all of the locals reviews are present in the data. Because of this big short
            coming all the results should be taken with a big grain of salt.
            <br>
            <br>
            One work around could be to redownload all the available data from Trip Adviser which allegedly
            should be easy and without limitations. In order to do so all the download code and preprocessing
            code would have to be rewritten, which is not viable at this point.


            <br>
            <br>

            Another work around for this could be to only concider attractions which has a 1000 or less reviews.
            This also has drawbacks since it basically removes all the attractions, that tourists who visit Denmark,
            would want to see in the first place. Furthermore it ruins big interconnections in the network, since
            everything is equally unpopular.



        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The results from both the text and network analysis should be considered with some skepticism due
            to the already mentioned shortcomings of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the text analysis, we found a few cases of words that appeared more frequent in the tourist reviews than
            the local reviews and vice versa. This indiciate more specific preferences in the places the two groups visit, e.g.
            is tourist mentioning "time" more, which confirms the assumption that tourist want to spend time efficiently and only
            visit places worth the time.
            <br>
            We tried to compare rating with the caption sentiments, and found that a lot of reviews were found neutral, but otherwise
            had the same pattern as the review ratings. Through these, we saw that local reviewers gave lower ratings than tourists.
            We had assumptions that it would be opposite and the locals were more biased towards liking their own neighbourhood,
            but this was not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            In regards to the network, we found that the tourist network
            and local network were far from random and had proper underlying network structure. The structure and
            characteristics of the two networks very quite alike, but with vastly different nodes being center of
            attention in each network.
            <br>

            Further we found, as
            expected, that the tourists were more interested in the big traditionally popular glamorous places such as
            The Little Mermaid etc. Where as the locals were more interested in the more subtly attractions such as
            various parks.
            <br>
            Additional, we found that the most popular attractions in the
            eyes of the tourists were more extreme than the most popular attraction in the yes of the locals. Which was
            expected as it confirms that tourists have some key places they are very likely to visit when in denmark.
            <br>
            Lastly and contrary to prior believes we found that the attractions were more tightly connected
            (shorter avg shortest path) in the tourist network meaning that the tourist visits a more diverse range of
            attractions. Here we assumed that the locals would be better at attended a wider range of attractions,
            (especially the less popular)
            thus better tying together their network. This was not the case.
        </p>

        <h2>Further Research</h2>
        <h3>How could this project evolve?</h3>
        <p>
            We have an idea for how this project could evolve. For the tokens of the reviews, it could be possible to categorize the tokens in groups like fun, history, family etc.
            to analyse what kind of goal a group of people seek when visiting Copenhagen or another specific location.
            <br>
            <br>
            Furthermore It would be interesting to redo the network analysis with proper data which is not limited in one way
            or another. The data from trip adviser seems as promising candidate for this.
