        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we investigate how locals and tourists of the Danish city Copenhagen each perceive the city in both their visitation behaviour and how to rate it.
            To do this, we will use data from Google Maps reviews of ~70 points of interest (POI) varying in popularity. We measure popularity with the amount of reviews.
        </p>

        <h2>The data</h2>
        <p>
            Our data consists of exactly 73 POIs with a total of 60,282 reviews. With each review, we extracted the tokens from the text and used the library langdetect to categorize
            the nationality of the reviews. After this, we have 15 columns, with these important ones:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>caption: The text of the review.</li>
            <li>relative_date: Time since reading the review, as reviews do not have exact dates.</li>
            <li>rating: A 1-5 integer rating of the POI.</li>
            <li>username: The public identification of the user, which is not unique.</li>
            <li>n_review_user: Count of how many total reviews the user has.</li>
            <li>attraction: The name of the POI.</li>
            <li>english: English tokens from the caption, will be null if the caption is Danish and vice versa.</li>
            <li>danish: Danish variant of the column "english".</li>
            <li>nationality: Either "da", "en" or null, used to determine if review is from a local or a tourist.</li>
        </ul>
